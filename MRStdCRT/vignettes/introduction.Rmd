# Introduction

The \`MRStdCRT\`\` package provides tools for computing the model-robust 
standardization estimator with jackknife variance estimator for the cluster 
average treatment effect(c-ATE) and individual average treatment effect(i-ATE) 
in clustered randomized trials (CRTs).

# Model robust standardization

In CRT, assume the cluster size $N_{i}$ is the natural cluster panel
size. The total sample size of the study is $N=\sum_{i=1}^m N_{i}$. Let
$A_i\in\{0,1\}$ be the randomized cluster-level treatment indicator,
with $A_i=1$ indicating the assignment to the treatment condition and
$A_i=0$ to usual care. The potential outcomes framework and define
$\{Y_{ij}(1),Y_{ij}(0)\}$ as a pair of potential outcomes for each
individual $j \in \{1,\dots, N_i\}$ under the treatment and usual care
conditions, respectively. Denote
$\boldsymbol{X}_i =  {\boldsymbol{X}_{i1},\dots,\boldsymbol{X}_{iN_i}}^\top$
as the collection of baseline covariates across all individual, and
$\boldsymbol{H}_i$ as the collection of cluster-level covariates.
Writing $f(a,b)$ as a pre-specified contrast function, a general class
of weighted average treatment effect in CRTs is defined as
$$\Delta_{\omega}=f(\mu_\omega(1),\mu_\omega(0)),$$ where the weighted
average potential outcome under treatment condition $A_i=a$ is
\begin{align*}
\mu_\omega(a)=\frac{E\left((\omega_i/N_i)\sum_{j=1}^{N_i}Y_{ij}(a)\right)}{E(\omega_i)}.
\end{align*}

In this formulation, $\omega_i$ is a pre-specified cluster-specific
weight determining the contribution of each cluster to the target
estimand, and can be at most a function of the cluster size $N_i$, or
additional cluster-level covariates $\boldsymbol{H}_i$. In CRTs, two
typical estimands of interest arise from different specifications of
$\omega_i$. First, setting $\omega_i=1$ gives each cluster equal weight
and leads to the \emph{cluster-average treatment effect},
$\Delta_C=f(\mu_C(1),\mu_C(0))$, with \begin{align*}
\mu_C(a)=E\left(\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N_i}Y_{ij}(a)}{N_i}\right).
\end{align*} Second, setting $\omega_i=N_i$ gives equal weight to each
individual in the study regardless of their cluster membership and leads
to the \emph{individual-average treatment effect},
$\Delta_I=f(\mu_I(1),\mu_I(0))$, with \begin{align*}
\mu_I(a)=\frac{E\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N_i}Y_{ij}(a)\right)}{E(N_i)}.
\end{align*} Under the general setup, the average potential outcomes can
be estimated by \begin{align*}
\widehat{\mu}_\omega(a)=\sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\omega_i}{\omega_{+}}\left\{\underbrace{\widehat{E}(\overline{Y}_{i}|A_i=a,\boldsymbol{X}_i,\boldsymbol{H}_i,N_i)}_{\text{regression prediction}}+\underbrace{\frac{I(A_i=a)\left(\overline{Y}_i-\widehat{E}(\overline{Y}_{i}|A_i=a,\boldsymbol{X}_i,\boldsymbol{H}_i,N_i)\right)}{\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i,\boldsymbol{H}_i,N_i)^a\left(1-\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i,\boldsymbol{H}_i,N_i)\right)^{1-a}}}_{\text{weighted cluster-level residual}}\right\},
\end{align*} where $\omega_{+}=\sum_{i=1}^m \omega_i$ is the sum of
weights across clusters,
$\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i,\boldsymbol{H}_i,N_i)=P(A_i=a|\boldsymbol{X}_i,\boldsymbol{H}_i,N_i)$
is the conditional randomization probability of each cluster given
baseline information, and
$\widehat{E}(\overline{Y}_{i}|A_i=a,\boldsymbol{X}_i,\boldsymbol{H}_i,N_i)$
is the conditional mean of the cluster average outcome,
$\overline{Y_i}=N_i^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N_i}Y_{ij}$, given baseline
covariates and cluster size, which could be estimated via any sensible
outcome regression model.

# Data Structure and Description

In the context of cluster-randomized trials (CRT), we observe the following data 
vector for each subject $j$ in cluster $i$:
$\{Y_{ij}, A_{i}, \boldsymbol{X}_{ij}, \boldsymbol{H}_i, N_i\}$, where:

-   $Y_{ij}$ represents the observed outcome for individual $j$ in cluster $i$,
-   $A_{i}$ is the treatment assignment for cluster $i$,
-   $\boldsymbol{X}_{ij}$ denotes the individual-level covariates,
-   $\boldsymbol{H}_i$ denotes the cluster-level covariates, 
-   $N_i$ is the number of individuals in cluster $i$.

Different working outcome mean models are proposed based on either 
individual-level observations or cluster-level summarizes (means),
which can be further used to construct the model-robust standardization estimator 
for either the weighted **cluster-averaged treatment effect (c-ATE)** or weighted
**individual-averaged treatment effect (i-ATE)**.

## Syntax

The primary data fitting function is `MRStdCRT_fit`, which generates a
summary for the target estimands, including both **c-ATE**
and **i-ATE**. In particular, the output provides:

-   The test statistics for testing non-informative cluster sizes,
-   The number of clusters,
-   The cluster sizes, 
-   The outcome regression model used.

User can call the `MRStdCRT_fit` function as follows:

`MRStdCRT_fit <- function(formula, data, clus_id, trt, prob, method,family,corstr,scale, jack, alpha)`

with the following arguments:

-   `formula`: The model formula for the outcome regression.
-   `data`: The dataset being analyzed.
-   `clus_id`: The identifier for the clusters.
-   `trt`: The treatment variable.
-   `prob`: The vector of treatment probabilities for each cluster.
-   `method`: The method used for outcome regression model fitting, i.e.
    "LM", "LMM", "GEE", "GLMM".
-   `family`: The distributional family for the outcome model (default
    is `gaussian(link="identity")`).
-   `corstr`: The correlation structure used in GEE or GLMM.
-   `scale`: The scale of estimand including risk difference (RD), risk
    ratio (RR), and odds ratio (RR).
-   `jack`: Categorical variable for jackknife variance estimator (default
    is 1, i.e., the standard jackknife variance estimator).
-   `alpha`: The significance level (default is 0.05).

# Illustrative example with PPACT data sets

## Illustrative Example

In this example, we demonstrate how to use the `MRStdCRT_fit` function to
estimate treatment effects in a CRT using the `ppact` dataset. The goal
is to estimate the cluster-averaged treatment effect (c-ATE) and the
individual-averaged treatment effect (i-ATE) using the marginal model fitted by 
generalized estimating equation (GEE).

### Step 1: Prepare the Treatment Assignment Probabilities

Before fitting the model, user needs to calculate the probabilities of
treatment assignment for each cluster, which is either known by design 
(e.g., simple randomization and pair-matched randomization) or estimated 
properly under covariate-constrained randomization. See Section 3.2 in the main
manuscript for more information.

For example, one can estimate the treatment assignment probabilities as follows:

``` r
library(MRStdCRT)
data(ppact)

ppact_prob <- ppact %>%
  group_by(CLUST) %>%
  mutate(first_trt = first(INTERVENTION)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(prob_A_1 = mean(first_trt == 1, na.rm = TRUE),  # Proportion trt = 1
         prob_A_0 = mean(first_trt == 0, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(assigned_value = ifelse(INTERVENTION == 1, prob_A_1, prob_A_0))

prob <- ppact_prob$assigned_value
```

### Step 2: Fit the `robust_CRT` Model

``` r
example <- MRStdCRT_fit(
  formula = PEGS ~ AGE + FEMALE + comorbid + Dep_OR_Anx + pain_count + PEGS_bl +
    BL_benzo_flag + BL_avg_daily + satisfied_primary + cluster(n),
  data = ppact,
  clus_id = "CLUST",
  trt = "INTERVENTION",
  prob = prob,
  method = "GEE",
  corstr = "independence",
  scale = "RR"
)
example$estimate
```
